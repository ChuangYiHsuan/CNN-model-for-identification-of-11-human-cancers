This directory displays example input files.  
We randomly selected 12 input files as examples.  
The file name can be split and recognized as four fragments.  
For example, in the file 'BRCA-N5-0-TCGA-BH-A1FE-11B-14R-A13Q-07,' we can split its name into four words: 'BRCA,' 'N5,' '0,' and 'TCGA-BH-A1FE-11B-14R-A13Q-07'.  

The following descriptions explain the meanings of these four terms:  

1. 'BRCA,' 'COAD,' 'HNSC,' and so on, are abbreviations for 11 cancer types.  

2. 'N5' indicates Normal sample number 5 (N5); if it is 'T5,' it means Tumor sample number 5 (T5).  

3. The '0' is the label for normal samples, and the ID numbers from 1 to 11 indicate the 11 cancer types.  

4. 'TCGA-BH-A1FE-11B-14R-A13Q-07' is an ID from the TCGA database, representing a unique tumor in a clinical patient.
